# gas-optimized-relayer
A experlimental gas-optimized solidity relayer contract.

## Conditions
- Compare three types of contracts.
- The relayed function is a lightweight `pure` function.
#### Contract Types
1. Secure contract utilizing a robust library such as OpenZeppelin.
2. Simplified contract omitting heavy code.
3. Optimized contract, which is an improved version of the Simplified contract, utilizing inline assembly

#### Relayed function
Sum of two arguments:
```sol
function sum(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
    return a + b;
}
```
## Result
- Mesure 3 times
  - The initial gas cost is higher due to the initialization of the storage slot for nonces.
- Display the amount of gas used and the reduction in gas consumption.
